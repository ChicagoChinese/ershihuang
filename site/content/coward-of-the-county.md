## Lyrics

Everyone considered him
<span class="target">大家都认为他是</span>
The coward of the county.
<span class="target">县里的懦夫。</span>
He'd never stood one single time
<span class="target">他从来没有站在一个单一的时间</span>
To prove the county wrong.
<span class="target">来证明县里的错误。</span>
His mama named him Tommy,
<span class="target">他妈妈给他起名叫汤米，</span>
But folks just called him Yellow.
<span class="target">但人们只叫他黄。</span>
Something always told me
<span class="target">总有东西告诉我，</span>
They were reading Tommy wrong.
<span class="target">他们把汤米读错了。</span>

He was only ten years old
<span class="target">他只有十岁，</span>
When his daddy died in prison.
<span class="target">他的父亲就死在监狱里。</span>
I looked after Tommy
<span class="target">我照顾着汤米，</span>
'Cause he was my brother's son.
<span class="target">因为他是我哥哥的儿子。</span>
I still recall the final words
My brother said to Tommy,
<span class="target">我仍然记得我哥哥对汤米说的最后一句话：</span>
"Son, my life is over,
<span class="target">"孩子，我的生活已经结束了，</span>
But yours has just begun.
<span class="target">但你的生活才刚刚开始。</span>

Promise me, son,
<span class="target">答应我，儿子，</span>
Not to do the things I've done.
<span class="target">不要做我做过的事。</span>
Walk away from trouble if you can.
<span class="target">如果你可以的话，远离麻烦。</span>
It won't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek.
<span class="target">如果你转过脸去，这并不意味着你很软弱。</span>
I hope you're old enough to understand:
<span class="target">我希望你已经长大，能够理解：</span>
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man."
<span class="target">儿子，你不必为成为一个男人而战斗。"</span>

There's someone for everyone,
<span class="target">每个人都有自己的爱人，</span>
And Tommy's love was Becky.
<span class="target">而汤米的爱人是贝琪。</span>
In her arms he didn't have to prove he was a man.
<span class="target">在她的怀抱里，他不必证明自己是个男人。</span>
One day while he was working
<span class="target">有一天，当他在工作时，</span>
The Gatlin boys came calling.
<span class="target">盖特林男孩来找他。</span>
They took turns at Becky.
<span class="target">他们轮流对贝琪下手。</span>
There was three of them.
<span class="target">他们有三个人。</span>

Tommy opened up the door
<span class="target">汤米打开门，</span>
And saw his Becky crying.
<span class="target">看到他的贝琪在哭。</span>
The torn dress, the shattered look
<span class="target">撕破的衣服，破碎的外观，</span>
Was more than he could stand.
<span class="target">让他无法忍受。</span>
He reached above the fireplace
<span class="target">他伸手到壁炉上方，</span>
And took down his daddy's picture.
<span class="target">取下他爸爸的照片。</span>
As his tears fell on his daddy's face
<span class="target">当他的眼泪落在他父亲的脸上时，</span>
He heard these words again,
<span class="target">他又听到了这些话、</span>

"Promise me, son,
<span class="target">"答应我，儿子，</span>
Not to do the things I've done.
<span class="target">不要做我做过的事。</span>
Walk away from trouble if you can.
<span class="target">如果你可以的话，就远离麻烦。</span>
Now it won't mean you're weak
If you turn the other cheek.
<span class="target">现在，如果你转过脸去，这并不意味着你软弱。</span>
I hope you're old enough to understand:
<span class="target">我希望你已经长大，能够理解：</span>
Son, you don't have to fight to be a man."
<span class="target">儿子，你不必为成为一个男人而战斗。"</span>

The Gatlin boys just laughed at him
When he walked into the bar room.
<span class="target">当他走进酒吧间时，加特林家的孩子们只是嘲笑他。</span>
One of them got up
<span class="target">他们中的一个人站了起来，</span>
And met him half way 'cross the floor.
<span class="target">在半路上遇到他。</span>
When Tommy turned around they said,
<span class="target">当汤米转身时，他们说，</span>
"Hey, look, old Yellow's leaving."
<span class="target">"嘿，看，老黄要走了。"</span>
But you could've heard a pin drop
When Tommy stopped and locked the door.
<span class="target">但当汤米停下脚步，锁上门时，你可以听到一根针掉下来。</span>

Twenty years of crawling
<span class="target">二十年来的摸爬滚</span>
Was bottled up inside him.
<span class="target">打在他的内心深处酝酿着。</span>
He wasn't holding nothing back,
<span class="target">他没有保留任何东西，</span>
He let 'em have it all.
<span class="target">他让他们拥有这一切。</span>
When Tommy left the bar room
<span class="target">当汤米离开酒吧间时，</span>
Not a Gatlin boy was standing.
<span class="target">没有一个盖特林男孩站着。</span>
He said, "This one's for Becky,"
<span class="target">他说，"这是给贝基的"，</span>
As he watched the last one fall.
<span class="target">他看着最后一个人倒下。</span>
And I heard him say,
<span class="target">我还听到他说：</span>

"I promised you, Dad,
<span class="target">"我答应过你，爸爸，</span>
Not to do the things you've done.
<span class="target">不做你做过的事。</span>
I walk away from trouble when I can.
<span class="target">当我可以时，我会远离麻烦。</span>
Now please don't think I'm weak.
<span class="target">现在请不要认为我很软弱。</span>
I didn't turn the other cheek.
<span class="target">我没有把另一边脸颊转过来。</span>
And, Papa, I sure hope you understand:
<span class="target">还有，爸爸，我肯定希望你能理解： 当</span>
Sometimes you gotta fight when you're a man."
<span class="target">你是一个男人的时候，有时你必须战斗。"</span>

Everyone considered him
<span class="target">大家都认为他是</span>
The coward of the county.
<span class="target">本县的懦夫。</span>
