## Lyrics

After we shot the grizzly,
<span class="target">在我们射杀灰熊之后，</span>
After the airship crashed,
<span class="target">在飞艇坠毁之后，</span>
After we lost the compass,
<span class="target">在我们失去指南针之后，</span>
After the radio went dead,
<span class="target">在无线电失灵之后、</span>

We shot and ate the horses.
<span class="target">我们射杀并吃掉了马匹。</span>
We marched through deadly swamps.
<span class="target">我们在致命的沼泽中行进。</span>
Inside a limestone cave,
<span class="target">在一个石灰岩洞里，</span>
I found a human skull.
<span class="target">我发现了一个人类头骨。</span>

Yes, Mary,
<span class="target">是的，玛丽，</span>
I found a human skull.
<span class="target">我发现了一个人的头骨。</span>

The captain caught a fever.
<span class="target"><span class="original">上尉发烧了。</span> <span class="correction">机长发烧了</span></span>
We tied him to a tree.
<span class="target">我们把他绑在一棵树上。</span>
We stared into the fire,
<span class="target">我们盯着火堆，</span>
And tried not to hear his screams.
<span class="target"><span class="original">试图不听他的尖叫声。</span> <span class="correction">假装听不到他的尖叫声。</span></span>

I killed a tiny antelope,
<span class="target">我杀了一只小羚羊，</span>
Not scared by my approach.
<span class="target">没有因为我的接近而害怕。</span>
We turned it over dying flames
<span class="target">我们把它翻过奄奄一息的火焰，</span>
As we huddled in the glow.
<span class="target">我们蜷缩在光芒中。</span>

Yes, Mary,
<span class="target">是的，玛丽，</span>
We huddled in the glow.
<span class="target">我们蜷缩在火光中。</span>

We built a raft from skin and bones.
<span class="target">我们用皮肤和骨头做了一个筏子。</span>
Only five could safely float.
<span class="target">只有五个人可以安全漂浮。</span>
The others stood upon the shore,
<span class="target">其他的人站在岸边，</span>
They screamed and threw sharp stones.
<span class="target">他们尖叫着扔出尖锐的石头。</span>

Yes, Mary,
<span class="target">是的，玛丽，</span>
They threw the sharpest stones.
<span class="target">他们扔了最尖锐的石头。</span>

But how the sea did spin us.
<span class="target"><span class="original">但大海是如何旋转我们。</span> <span class="correction">但大海是如何旋转我们的。</span></span>
How the waves did roar.
<span class="target">海浪如何咆哮。</span>
The captain jumped into the storm,
<span class="target"><span class="original">船长跳进风暴中，</span> <span class="correction">机长跳进风暴中，</span></span>
Then we were but four.
<span class="target">然后我们只有四个人。</span>

One by one, we chose our straws
<span class="target">一个接一个，我们选择了我们的稻草，</span>
'Til only I remained.
<span class="target">直到只剩下我。</span>
But Mary, you are with me now
<span class="target">但玛丽，你现在与我同在，</span>
All around me in the waves.
<span class="target">在我周围的海浪中。</span>

Yes, Mary,
<span class="target">是的，玛丽，</span>
You are in the waves.
<span class="target">你在海浪中。</span>
