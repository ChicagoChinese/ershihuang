## Lyrics

With a body length of about 20 centimeters,
<span class="target">牛蛙的体长约为20厘米，</span>
Bullfrogs are the largest frogs in North America,
<span class="target">是北美最大的青蛙，</span>
As well as the champion jumpers.
<span class="target">同时也是跳跃的冠军。</span>

Long Legged Larry was a frog at the pond.
<span class="target">长腿拉里是池塘里的一只青蛙。</span>
Jump so high, might miss him while he gone.
<span class="target">跳得很高，在他离开时可能会错过他。</span>
Jump over anything, even King Kong.
<span class="target">跳过任何东西，甚至金刚。</span>
Jumping Jack Flash was his favorite song.
<span class="target">跳跃的杰克 "是他最喜欢的歌曲。</span>
Now once upon a time there was a cat in a tree,
<span class="target">从前有只猫在树上，</span>
Chased a squirrel up, been stuck since three.
<span class="target">追着一只松鼠跑，从三点开始就卡住了。</span>
The fireman came, said "It's too high for me".
<span class="target">消防员来了，说 "这对我来说太高了"。</span>
How's that cat gonna ever get free?
<span class="target">那只猫怎么可能获得自由呢？</span>
Young Jack Turner was a staple on the block,
<span class="target">年轻的杰克-特纳是街区的主力军，</span>
Said he knew about a frog with an XL hop.
<span class="target">他说他知道有一只青蛙会跳得很厉害。</span>
The neighbors started laughing, but Jackie wouldn't stop.
<span class="target">邻居们开始大笑，但杰克不肯罢休。</span>
Ran off, came back, guess who he got?
<span class="target">他跑了，又回来了，你猜他抓到了谁？</span>
Well, it was Long Legged Larry, didn't open his mouth,
<span class="target">好吧，是长腿拉里，他没有开口，</span>
Like a rocket to the moon through a cumulus cloud,
<span class="target">就像火箭穿过积雨云飞向月球，</span>
Touch down safe, lay the scaredy-cat on the ground.
<span class="target">安全着陆，把那只胆小的猫放在地上。如果你听得很仔细，</span>
If you listen real close, you can still hear the crowd.
<span class="target">你还能听到人群的声音。</span>

Go Larry, go Larry, go, go, go Larry.
<span class="target">去吧，拉里，去吧，拉里，去吧，拉里。</span>
Go Larry, go Larry, go, go, go, go, go.
<span class="target">走吧，拉里，走吧，拉里，走吧，走吧，走吧。</span>

Larry doesn't care.
<span class="target">拉里并不关心。</span>
Jump so high grow a beard in the air.
<span class="target">跳得那么高，在空中长出胡须。</span>
Jump over anything, even Times Square.
<span class="target">跳过任何东西，甚至时代广场。</span>
Yelling "Long Legged Larry for mayor! Here! Here!"
<span class="target">喊着 "长腿拉里竞选市长！"！这里! 这里！这里！"</span>
Now once upon a time there was a princess in a cell.
<span class="target">现在，很久以前，有一位公主在牢房里。</span>
In the tower of a castle, through a forest on a hill.
<span class="target">在一座城堡的塔楼里，穿过一座山上的森林。</span>
Half the men that ever sought her out had fallen ill.
<span class="target">曾经找过她的人，有一半都病倒了。</span>
All the men that ever tried to climb the wall had fell.
<span class="target">所有试图爬上城墙的人都倒下了。</span>
Handful gather at the base of the place,
<span class="target">一小撮人聚集在山脚下，</span>
Each claim way braver than the bravest you've faced,
<span class="target">每个人都声称自己比你所面对的最勇敢的人更勇敢，</span>
Bunch of dingbats yapping about saving the day.
<span class="target">一群笨蛋嚷嚷着要拯救这一天。</span>
But wait, a silhouetted amphibian face in haze.
<span class="target">但是等一下，在朦胧中出现了一张两栖动物的剪影。</span>
Well, it was Long Legged Larry on the back of a steed.
<span class="target">好吧，那是长腿拉里，他骑在一匹骏马的背上。</span>
Leapt up yelling "Jordan!" Kiss the girl on the cheek.
<span class="target">跃起大喊 "乔丹！" 亲吻女孩的脸颊。</span>
Touch down safe, show the lady back to her peeps.
<span class="target">安全着陆，把这位女士带回她的伙伴们身边。</span>
If you listen real close, you can still hear the streets.
<span class="target">如果你听得真切，你还能听到街上的声音。</span>

Go Larry, go Larry, go, go, go Larry.
<span class="target">去吧，拉里，去吧，拉里，去吧，拉里。</span>
Go Larry, go Larry, go, go, go, go, go.
<span class="target">走吧，拉里，走吧，拉里，走吧，走吧，走吧。</span>

Larry's on the case.
<span class="target">拉里正在处理这个案子。</span>
Jump so high pluck a star out of space.
<span class="target">跳得那么高，从太空中摘下一颗星星。</span>
Jump over anything, even Salt Lake.
<span class="target">跳过任何东西，甚至盐湖。</span>
Jump into the mosh pit, jump out of a cake.
<span class="target">跳进沼泽坑，跳出蛋糕。</span>
Now once upon a time there was a circus in town.
<span class="target">很久很久以前，镇上有一个马戏团。</span>
Some went for the cotton candy, some for the clowns,
<span class="target">有些人去看棉花糖，有些人去看小丑，</span>
But the high wire act was the most profound.
<span class="target">但高空钢丝表演是最深刻的。</span>
Had a poodle on a unicycle, rose in her mouth.
<span class="target">有一只狮子狗骑着独轮车，嘴里叼着玫瑰。</span>
Ten o'clock show get the poodle in position.
<span class="target">十点钟的表演让狮子狗就位。</span>
Ten seconds in the unicycle starts tipping,
<span class="target">十秒钟后，独轮车开始倾斜，</span>
Now the poodle barely clinging to the wire by her mittens.
<span class="target">现在狮子狗勉强靠她的手套紧紧抓住钢丝。</span>
But what the heck is that thing in the distance?
<span class="target">但是，远处的那个东西到底是什么？</span>
Ribbit, Long Legged Larry, a sight for sore eyes.
<span class="target">肋骨，长腿拉里，让人眼花缭乱的东西。</span>
Known to give a dog a ride seconds after he arrives.
<span class="target">在他到达后的几秒钟内，他就会带着一只狗去兜风。</span>
Touch down safe, give her some kibbles and rawhide.
<span class="target">安全着陆，给她一些狗粮和生皮。</span>
If you listen real close, you can still hear the vibe.
<span class="target">如果你听得很仔细，你还能听到那股气息。</span>

Go Larry, go Larry, go, go, go Larry.
<span class="target">去吧，拉里，去吧，拉里，去吧，拉里。</span>
Go Larry, go Larry, go, go, go, go, go.
<span class="target">走吧，拉里，走吧，拉里，走吧，走吧，走吧。</span>
